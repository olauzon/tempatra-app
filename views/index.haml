    A [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/ "Sinatra") application using [Blueprint CSS](http://www.blueprintcss.org/ "Blueprint CSS"), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/ "jQuery"), [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/ "Haml"), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/ "Sass"), [Compass](http://compass-style.org/ "Compass"), [RSpec](http://rspec.info/), [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/), and [Webrat](http://gitrdoc.com/brynary/webrat/tree/master/).

    This is a default Sinatra application generated with [Tempatra](http://github.com/olauzon/tempatra). It is intended for designers and developers who are starting to use Sinatra, Haml, Sass, Compass, or jQuery. Tempatra provides a quick & dirty template to make design mock-ups.

    The suggested workflow is to write Cucumber features first, outlining the important elements and interactions of the interface to be designed.

    Combined with [Heroku](http://heroku.com), a design idea can quickly evolve to a publicly available prototype to share with clients and colleagues.

    Writing framework generators is fun and easy, thanks largely to the excellent [RubiGen gem](http://drnic.github.com/rubigen/).
